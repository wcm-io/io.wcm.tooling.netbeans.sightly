* if user uses data-sly-use, we should be able to find the actual available parameters on next usage
<foo data-sly-use.ipsum="${my.class.Foo}>... ipsum.WE_KNOW_YOUR_PARAMETERS!!

* classlookupcompleter currently does not check if there is a data-sly-use before it

* classlookupcompleter currently does not filter out unusable classes (e.g. display only @Model?)

* there are many missing classes in buildInClasses

* generalize the detection/usage of parameters (currently this has to be done in each addItems method)

* generalize the detection of the start of the entered text

* add license headers

* setup upgrade center or deploy into netbeans upgrade center

* cleanup/document code

* examples of usage

* add documentation for data-sly-commands and buildin classes

* display documentation for resolved classes
